So this is the first in a series of "Words of Wisdom" picked up from various places, about software, that can be worth contemplating about.

![Words of Wisdom #1](/images/wow_1_web.png "Words of Wisdom #1")

#### Software delivers it’s value in production

Nygard, M. T.(2018) Living in Production. In *Release It*, Second Edition (pp. 6).

#### When your codebase looks like spaghetti, it’s too late

This is just a fact. Who will pay for rewriting the software, and how do you motivate it?

#### Working Code Isn't Enough

Ousterhout, J. (2018) A Philosophy of Software Design, (pp. 13).

#### Fight all complexity

Rephrased, but its origin stems from Ousterhout, J. (2018) *A Philosophy of Software Design*, (pp. 1).

#### Modules, Classes and Functions should be deep

Rephrased, but its origin stems once again from Ousterhout, J. (2018) *A Philosophy of Software Design*, (pp. 19).

#### Always be aware of leaking abstractions

We use abstractions to hide complexity. If the inner workings is leaking through, so does complexity and dependencies.

#### TDD and Pair Programming are tools, learn and use them wisely

Just our opinionated view.

If you have any Words of Wisdom of your own and want to share, please send a dm on twitter or mail to lars(at)thenatureofsoftware.se and I will try to collect them.
